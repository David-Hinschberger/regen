/*
 The functions in this file work together to create a string that matches the input regex.  The regex is represented
 as a parse tree where nodes in the tree ("tokens") represent either a charater class (one or more characters) or
 an operator on the subtree, which could consist of character classes or other operators.
 
 The goal is to create a string, and to that end, the wrapper function generate_string prepares an initial array
 and sets up variables relating to its length and the next spot avaliable in the string.  A pointer to this string
 is passed back once a function is done working with it.
 
 Characters are only added to the string through the charclass0 function; other operators simply specify which character
 classes get to add their characters then.
 
 Because random values are used to generate the string, it's not possible to know exactly how big it'll be in the end.
 Thus, reallocation of the string in a vector-like fashion is required.
 
 With the exception of the function generate_string, all functions have the same parameters and return values:
 @param subtree A pointer to the root of the subtree being parsed into the string
 @param string a pointer to the char array which holds the string the regex output is being written to
 @param next The next avaliable spot in the string
 @param arrlen The current length of the string array.  Will be increased as necessary.
 @return the pointer to the output string
 
 The only function meant to be called by functions outside of this file is generate_string.

/*
 * Instruction code 0: element is a character class.  Select one element from the character class.
 * Instruction code 1: execute all elements in sequence.  Can be thought of as () as well.
 * Instruction code 2: *  Repeat everything in element until random stop point
 * Instruction code 3: +  Add one, then repeat until random stop point.
 * Instruction code 4: ?  50/50 shot of it being there.
 * Instruction code 5: {n} Repeat n of times.
 * Instruction code 6: {n:m} Repeat at least n but no more than m times.
 * Instruction code 7: | select one of element, at random.  Similar to 0, but not necessarily a character class.
